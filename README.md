Python parser for FIO results

Set 'fio_results_variable' to the local directory with the FIO results.  This should be set at the directory level named after the storage device tested.  For example, if testing an Intel SSD, your folder level would be something like this "~/intel_ssd/"

Set 'output' to local file for results csv

Set 'device_name' to an identifiable name of the storage device tested

Every time you run this the output files will overwrite the file if the name is the same
